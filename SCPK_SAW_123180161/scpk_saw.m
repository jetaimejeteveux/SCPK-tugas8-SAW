function varargout = scpk_saw(varargin)
% SCPK_SAW MATLAB code for scpk_saw.fig
%      SCPK_SAW, by itself, creates a new SCPK_SAW or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SCPK_SAW returns the handle to a new SCPK_SAW or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SCPK_SAW('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SCPK_SAW.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SCPK_SAW('Property','Value',...) creates a new SCPK_SAW or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before scpk_saw_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to scpk_saw_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
